# Quick start
Run `npm run init-start` to install dependencies, fetch quizzes and start the application.

# Get up and practising
This web app lets you practice in a similar environment to an actual Linkedin quiz. 

The quizzes are fetched from another GitHub repo that seems to have good momentum on updates: https://github.com/Ebazhanov/linkedin-skill-assessments-quizzes

So.. What are you waiting for? Practice linked!

# Command line 
`npm start` starts the application.

`npm install` installs the necessary packages.

`npm run clone-quizzes` performs a git clone on the quizzes repo.
`npm run pull-quizzes` pulls the latest changes from an already cloned repo.
`npm run fetch-quizzes` clones the quizzes if not already done, if not, it pulls the latest changes

`npm run init-start` does everything above: installs dependencies, fetches quizzes and starts the application.

# How it works (for users;)
